# Day X: Percentage Calculations - 2025-06-21

Today, June 21st, 2025, we're tackling a fundamental topic for CAT preparation: **Percentage Calculations**. Percentages are ubiquitous in the quantitative aptitude section, and mastering them is crucial for solving a wide range of problems quickly and accurately.

## Why are Percentages Important?

Percentages form the basis for understanding:

*   **Ratio and Proportion:** Percentages are essentially ratios expressed in relation to 100.
*   **Profit and Loss:** Calculating profit margins and discounts heavily relies on percentage calculations.
*   **Simple and Compound Interest:** Understanding percentage increase and decrease is essential for these topics.
*   **Data Interpretation:** Many DI sets involve analyzing data presented as percentages.

## Core Concepts and Formulas

Before diving into problem-solving, let's refresh the key concepts:

*   **Percentage:** Representing a part of a whole, expressed as a fraction of 100.  `Percentage = (Part / Whole) * 100`
*   **Percentage Increase:**  `Percentage Increase = ((New Value - Original Value) / Original Value) * 100`
*   **Percentage Decrease:** `Percentage Decrease = ((Original Value - New Value) / Original Value) * 100`
*   **Converting Percentage to Fraction:** Divide the percentage by 100.  Example: 25% = 25/100 = 1/4
*   **Converting Fraction to Percentage:** Multiply the fraction by 100. Example: 3/4 = (3/4) * 100 = 75%

## Practice Problems

Let's work through some practice problems to solidify our understanding.

**Problem 1:**

A shopkeeper marked up the price of an article by 20% and then gave a discount of 10% on the marked price. What is the percentage profit?

**Solution:**

Let the original price be ₹100.

*   Marked Price = ₹100 + (20% of ₹100) = ₹120
*   Discount = 10% of ₹120 = ₹12
*   Selling Price = ₹120 - ₹12 = ₹108
*   Profit = ₹108 - ₹100 = ₹8
*   Profit Percentage = (₹8 / ₹100) * 100 = 8%

**Answer:** The shopkeeper made a profit of 8%.

**Problem 2:**

The price of sugar is increased by 25%. By what percentage must a family reduce its consumption of sugar so as not to increase its expenditure?

**Solution:**

Let the original price of sugar be ₹100 per kg and the original consumption be 1 kg.
Original Expenditure = ₹100 * 1 = ₹100

New price of sugar = ₹100 + (25% of ₹100) = ₹125 per kg.

Let the new consumption be x kg.  The expenditure should still remain ₹100.

So, ₹125 * x = ₹100
x = ₹100 / ₹125 = 0.8 kg

Reduction in consumption = 1 kg - 0.8 kg = 0.2 kg

Percentage reduction in consumption = (0.2 / 1) * 100 = 20%

**Answer:** The family must reduce its consumption by 20%.

**Problem 3:**

In an examination, 40% of the students failed in mathematics, 30% failed in English. If 10% failed in both subjects, then what is the percentage of students who passed in both subjects?

**Solution:**

Let the total number of students be 100.

*   Students failed in Mathematics = 40
*   Students failed in English = 30
*   Students failed in both = 10

Students failed in either Mathematics or English or both = 40 + 30 - 10 = 60

Therefore, the number of students who passed in both subjects = 100 - 60 = 40

Percentage of students who passed in both subjects = (40 / 100) * 100 = 40%

**Answer:** 40% of the students passed in both subjects.

## Tips and Tricks for CAT

*   **Memorize Common Percentage-Fraction Equivalents:**  Knowing that 12.5% = 1/8, 16.67% = 1/6, 33.33% = 1/3, etc., can save valuable time.
*   **Use the '10% Method':**  Calculating 10% of a number is easy (move the decimal one place to the left).  You can then easily find multiples of 10% or use it to approximate other percentages.
*   **Understand Percentage Change:** Distinguish clearly between the original value and the new value when calculating percentage increase or decrease.  Pay close attention to *what* the percentage is *of*.
*   **Practice Regularly:**  Solve a variety of problems to build confidence and speed.

## Further Practice

*   Solve problems from previous CAT papers related to percentages.
*   Practice with online quizzes and mock tests.
*   Focus on identifying the core percentage concepts within larger problems.
