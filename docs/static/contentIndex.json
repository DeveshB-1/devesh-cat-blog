Percentages are ubiquitous in the quantitative aptitude section, and mastering them is crucial for solving a wide range of problems quickly and accurately.\n \n## Why are Percentages Important?\n \nPercentages form the basis for understanding:\n \n*   **Ratio and Proportion:** Percentages are essentially ratios expressed in relation to 100.\n*   **Profit and Loss:** Calculating profit margins and discounts heavily relies on percentage calculations.\n*   **Simple and Compound Interest:** Understanding percentage increase and decrease is essential for these topics.\n*   **Data Interpretation:** Many DI sets involve analyzing data presented as percentages.\n \n## Core Concepts and Formulas\n \nBefore diving into problem-solving, let&#039;s refresh the key concepts:\n \n*   **Percentage:** Representing a part of a whole, expressed as a fraction of 100.  `Percentage = (Part / Whole) * 100`\n*   **Percentage Increase:**  `Percentage Increase = ((New Value - Original Value) / Original Value) * 100`\n*   **Percentage Decrease:** `Percentage Decrease = ((Original Value - New Value) / Original Value) * 100`\n*   **Converting Percentage to Fraction:** Divide the percentage by 100.  Example: 25% = 25/100 = 1/4\n*   **Converting Fraction to Percentage:** Multiply the fraction by 100. Example: 3/4 = (3/4) * 100 = 75%\n \n## Practice Problems\n \nLet&#039;s work through some practice problems to solidify our understanding.\n \n**Problem 1:**\n \nA shopkeeper marked up the price of an article by 20% and then gave a discount of 10% on the marked price. What is the percentage profit?\n \n**Solution:**\n \nLet the original price be ₹100.\n \n*   Marked Price = ₹100 + (20% of ₹100) = ₹120\n*   Discount = 10% of ₹120 = ₹12\n*   Selling Price = ₹120 - ₹12 = ₹108\n*   Profit = ₹108 - ₹100 = ₹8\n*   Profit Percentage = (₹8 / ₹100) * 100 = 8%\n \n**Answer:** The shopkeeper made a profit of 8%.\n \n**Problem 2:**\n \nThe price of sugar is increased by 25%. By what percentage must a family reduce its consumption of sugar so as not to increase its expenditure?\n \n**Solution:**\n \nLet the original price of sugar be ₹100 per kg and the original consumption be 1 kg.\nOriginal Expenditure = ₹100 * 1 = ₹100\n \nNew price of sugar = ₹100 + (25% of ₹100) = ₹125 per kg.\n \nLet the new consumption be x kg.  The expenditure should still remain ₹100.\n \nSo, ₹125 * x = ₹100\nx = ₹100 / ₹125 = 0.8 kg\n \nReduction in consumption = 1 kg - 0.8 kg = 0.2 kg\n \nPercentage reduction in consumption = (0.2 / 1) * 100 = 20%\n \n**Answer:** The family must reduce its consumption by 20%.\n \n**Problem 3:**\n \nIn an examination, 40% of the students failed in mathematics, 30% failed in English. If 10% failed in both subjects, then what is the percentage of students who passed in both subjects?\n \n**Solution:**\n \nLet the total number of students be 100.\n \n*   Students failed in Mathematics = 40\n*   Students failed in English = 30\n*   Students failed in both = 10\n \nStudents failed in either Mathematics or English or both = 40 + 30 - 10 = 60\n \nTherefore, the number of students who passed in both subjects = 100 - 60 = 40\n \nPercentage of students who passed in both subjects = (40 / 100) * 100 = 40%\n \n**Answer:** 40% of the students passed in both subjects.\n \n## Tips and Tricks for CAT\n \n*   **Memorize Common Percentage-Fraction Equivalents:**  Knowing that 12.5% = 1/8, 16.67% = 1/6, 33.33% = 1/3, etc., can save valuable time.\n*   **Use the &#039;10% Method&#039;:**  Calculating 10% of a number is easy (move the decimal one place to the left).  You can then easily find multiples of 10% or use it to approximate other percentages.\n*   **Understand Percentage Change:** Distinguish clearly between the original value and the new value when calculating percentage increase or decrease.  Pay close attention to *what* the percentage is *of*.\n*   **Practice Regularly:**  Solve a variety of problems to build confidence and speed.\n \n## Further Practice\n \n*   Solve problems from previous CAT papers related to percentages.\n*   Practice with online quizzes and mock tests.\n*   Focus on identifying the core percentage concepts within larger problems.\n \nTomorrow, we&#039;ll delve into another essential topic for CAT preparation. Keep practicing! Good luck!"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"Welcome","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Day 0\nBlog starts here!"}}
